/** @file    taskshare.h
 *  @brief   Data which can be shared between tasks in a thread-safe manner.
 *  @details This file contains a template class for data which is to be shared
 *           between tasks. The data must be protected against damage due to 
 *           context switches, so it is protected by a mutex or by causing 
 *           transfers to take place inside critical sections of code which are
 *           not interrupted. This version is known to work on STM32's and 
 *           ESP32's only because the insertion and extraction operators @c <<
 *           and @c >> need specific functions to determine if they're running 
 *           in ISR's or not.

/** @brief   Class for data to be shared in a thread-safe manner between tasks.
 *  @details This class implements an item of data which can be shared between
 *           tasks without the risk of data corruption associated with global 
 *           variables. Unlike queues, shares do not use a buffer for many data
 *           items; there is only a one-item buffer in which the most recent
 *           value of the data is kept. Shares therefore do not provide the 
 *           task synchronization or incur the overhead associated with queues. 
 * 
 *           The data is protected by using critical code sections (see the 
 *           FreeRTOS documentation of @c portENTER_CRITICAL() ) so that tasks 
 *           can't interrupt each other when reading or writing the data is 
 *           taking place. This prevents data corruption due to thread 
 *           switching. The C++ template mechanism is used to ensure that only
 *           data of the correct type is put into or taken from a shared data
 *           item. A @c TaskShare<DataType> object keeps its own separate copy
 *           of the data. This uses some memory, but it is necessary to 
 *           reliably prevent data corruption; it prevents possible side 
 *           effects from causing the sender's copy of the data from being
 *           inadvertently changed. 
 * 
 *           @section usage_share Usage
 *           The following bits of code show how to set up and use a share to
 *           transfer data of type @c uint16_t from one hypothetical task 
 *           called @c task_A to another called @c task_B.
 *  
 *           In the file which contains @c setup() we create a shared data
 *           object. The constructor of the @c Share<uint16_t> class is given
 *           a name for the share; the name will be shown on system diagnostic
 *           printouts. If it is desired to print diagnostic information to a
 *           serial monitor, a pointer to an output stream may also be given:
 *           @code{.cpp}
 *           #include "taskshare.h"
 *           ...
 *           /// Data from sensor number 3 on the moose's right antler
 *           Share<uint16_t> my_share ("Data_3", &Serial);
 *           @endcode
 *           If there are any tasks which use this share in other source files,
 *           we must re-declare this share with the keyword @c extern near the
 *           top of those files to make it accessible to those task(s). This
 *           copy of the share does not need a Doxygen comment:
 *           @code
 *           // Sensor 3 (right antler) data
 *           extern Share<uint16_t> my_share;
 *           @endcode
 *           In the sending task, data is put into the share:
 *           @code
 *           uint16_t a_data_item = 42;     ///< Holds antler data
 *           ...
 *           a_data_item = antler3 ();      // Get the data
 *           my_share.put (a_data_item);    // Put data into share
 *           @endcode
 *           In the receiving task, data is read from the share:
 *           @code
 *           uint16_t got_data;             ///< Holds received data
 *           ...
 *           my_share.get (got_data);       // Get local copy of shared data
 *           @endcode
 * 
 *           @b The @b Easy @b Way
 *           It's also possible to use overloaded stream insertion and 
 *           extraction operators to interact with the share. These operators
 *           contain code which checks if they're running in an interrupt
 *           service routine (ISR) or not and use the appropriate method to
 *           interact with the internal queue which holds the data, so they're
 *           a little slower than @c put() and @c get(). Usage is as follows,
 *           assuming that the share and local variable have been set up above:
 *           @code
 *           my_share << a_data_item;       // In sending task
 *           ...
 *           my_share >> got_data;          // In receiving task
 *           @endcode
