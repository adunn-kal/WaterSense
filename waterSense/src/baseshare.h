 *  @brief   Headers for a base class for type-safe, thread-safe task data 
 *           exchange classes.
 *  @details This file contains a base class for classes which exchange data 
 *           between tasks. Inter-task data must be exchanged in a thread-safe 
 *           manner, so the classes which share the data use mutexes or mutual 
 *           exclusion mechanisms to prevent corruption of data. A linked list
 *           of all inter-task data items is kept by this system, and this base
 *           class contains members that handle that linked list.
