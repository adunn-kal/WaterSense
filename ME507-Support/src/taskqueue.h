/** @file taskqueue.h
 *    This file contains a very simple wrapper class for the FreeRTOS queue. 
 *    It makes using the queue just a little bit easier in C++ than it is in C.
 *    This version has been tested on STM32's and ESP32's only because the 
 *    insertion and extraction operators @c << and @c >> need specific 
 *    functions to determine if they're running in ISR's or not. 
 *
 *  @date 2012-Oct-21 JRR Original file
 *  @date 2014-Aug-26 JRR Changed file names and queue class name to Queue
 *  @date 2020-Oct-10 JRR Made compatible with Arduino/FreeRTOS environment
 *  @date 2020-Nov-18 JRR Added @c << and @c >> operators for ESP32 and STM32
 *  @date 2021-Sep-19 JRR Added overloads of @c get(), @c ISR_get(), @c peek(), 
 *                        and @c ISR_peek() which return copies

/** @brief   Implements a queue to transmit data from one RTOS task to another. 
 *  @details Since multithreaded tasks must not use unprotected shared data 
 *           items for communication, queues are a primary means of intertask 
 *           communication. Other means include shared data items (see 
 *           @c taskshare.h) and carrier pigeons. The use of a C++ class
 *           template allows the compiler to check that you're putting the 
 *           correct type of data into each queue and getting the correct type
 *           of data out, thus helping to prevent programming mistakes that can
 *           corrupt your data. 
 * 
 *           As a template class, @c Queue<dataType> can be used to make 
 *           queues which hold data of many types. "Plain Old Data" types such
 *           as @c bool or @c uint16_t are supported, of course. But you can 
 *           also use queues which hold compound data types. For example, if
 *           you have @c class @c my_data which holds several measurements 
 *           together in an object, you can make a queue for @c my_data objects
 *           with @c Queue<my_data>.  Each item in the queue will then hold
 *           several measurements. 
 * 
 *           The size of FreeRTOS queues is limited to 255 items in 8-bit 
 *           microcontrollers whose @c portBASE_TYPE is an 8-bit number. This 
 *           is a FreeRTOS feature. 
 * 
 *           Normal writing and reading are done with methods @c put() and 
 *           @c get(). Normal writing means that the sending task must wait 
 *           until there is empty space in the queue, and then it puts a data
 *           item into the "back" of the queue, where "back" means that the 
 *           item in the back of the queue will be read after all items that 
 *           were previously put into the queue have been read. Normal reading
 *           means that when an item is read from the front of the queue, it 
 *           will then be removed, making space for more items at the back. 
 *           This process is often used to synchronize tasks, as the reading 
 *           task's @c get() method blocks, meaning that the reading task gets
 *           stuck waiting for an item to arrive in the queue; it won't do 
 *           anything useful until new data has been read. Note that this is 
 *           acceptable behavior in an RTOS because the RTOS scheduler will
 *           ensure that other tasks get to run even while the reading task 
 *           is blocking itself waiting for data. 
 * 
 *           In some cases, one may need to use less normal reading and writing
 *           methods. Methods whose name begins with @c ISR_ are to be used 
 *           only within a hardware interrupt service routine. If there is a
 *           need to put data at the front of the queue instead of the back, 
 *           use @c butt_in() instead of @c put(). If one needs to read data 
 *           from the queue without removing that data, the @c look_at() method
 *           allows this to be done. If something particularly unusual needs to
 *           be done with the queue, one can use the method @c get_handle() to
 *           retrieve the handle used by the C language functions in FreeRTOS
 *           to access the Queue object's underlying data structure directly. 
 * 
 *           @section queue_usage Usage
 *           The following bits of code show how to set up and use a queue to
 *           transfer data of type @c int16_t from one hypothetical task 
 *           called @c task_A to another called @c task_B.
 *  
 *           Near the top of the file which contains @c setup() we create a 
 *           queue. The constructor of the @c Queue<int16_t> class is given the
 *           number of items in the queue (10 in this example) and an optional 
 *           name for the queue: 
 *           @code
 *           #include "taskqueue.h"
 *           ...
 *           /// This queue holds hockey puck accelerations
 *           Queue<int16_t> hockey_queue (10, "Puckey");
 *           @endcode
 *           In a location which is before we use the queue in any other file
 *           than the one in which the queue was created, we re-declare the
 *           queue with the keyword @c extern to make it accessible to any task
 *           within that file:
 *           @code
 *           extern Queue<int16_t> hockey_queue;
 *           @endcode
 *           In the sending task, data is put into the queue:
 *           @code
 *           int16_t an_item = -3;                 ///< Local acceleration data
 *           ...
 *           an_item = stick_sensor.get_data (2);  // Read data from sensor 
 *           hockey_queue.put (a_data_item);       // Put data into queue
 *           @endcode
 *           In the receiving task, data is read from the queue. In typical 
 *           usage, the call to @c get() will block the receiving task until 
 *           data has been put into the queue by the sending task:
 *           @code
 *           int16_t data_we_got;                  ///< Holds received data
 *           ...
 *           hockey_queue.get (data_we_got);       // Get data from the queue
 *           @endcode
